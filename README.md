Global Game Jam 2024 - Papa Jokes!

Papa Jokes - No one out jokes the Papa

A Joke Delivery Game inspired by our team buying Dominoes individually over the Game Jam weekend while trying to figure out what to do based on the theme of "Make me laugh" so we took it seriously!

Your job, is to meet a quota of satisfied, laughing customers before the timer runs out.
If you succeed, you will start another day working the job you love! (Congrats, it's a 4 day work week!)

Be careful! Not everyone is in a good mood everyday.

Each door's colour will symbolize the Resident's mood.

Grey = Don't go near me
Green = Happy - Needs 1 Joke
Yellow = Meh - Needs 2 Jokes
Red = Angry - Needs 3 Jokes

Ready to serve up some laughs!?
